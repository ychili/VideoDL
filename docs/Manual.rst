.. This is an alternate manual for users without the ability to open the
   gzipped troff manuals.

This is the plain-text manual for VideoDL.
The command-line script is called ``video-dl``,
and the associated configuration file format is called VideoDL.conf.

USAGE
=====

The script loads an INI-style configuration file containing all the
information it needs to manage the download. The scriptâ€™s positional
arguments, your job identifiers, specify which config sections are to be
executed.

The script will search for configuration files in the following places:

**Windows:**

-  ``%APPDATA%\VideoDL\*``
-  ``%USERPROFILE%\VideoDL\*``
-  ``%USERPROFILE%\VideoDL.conf``

**POSIX:**

-  ``/etc/VideoDL.conf``
-  ``${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/VideoDL/*``
-  ``${HOME}/.config/VideoDL/*``
-  ``${HOME}/.VideoDL.conf``

If the argument to ``--config`` is an absolute path, the script will go
straight to that file. Otherwise it will search for the argument in the
locations signified by ``*`` above, or, if no argument, for the default
configuration file, ``default.conf``. In addition, the script will
search the current directory for the argument to ``--config`` or a file
named ``VideoDL.conf``.

Command-line arguments
----------------------

.. include:: include/SYNOPSIS.rst

Will perform the download job specified in the *job-identifier* section of
the loaded configuration.
If *job-identifier* is omitted, it performs all jobs in all sections.
A job that fails or cannot be successfully performed
will be skipped and the next tried.

Optional arguments

.. include:: include/OPTIONS.rst
